# JWT-Django-Rest-Framework-React

We will go over the entire authentication process using Django and React in this tutorial series. From project setup to git setup to backend configuration to JWT (access + refresh) configuration to building APIs and private routeÂ end points. Then to frontend using react , setup our projects, implement route-guards, preserving user information in the browser, and pure react hooks (no Redux), these are what we'd be covering in the series. This video will be broken into two parts: the front end, which will set up the CLient side, and the back end, which will create the APIs.
